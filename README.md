# Exemplar

*Create tiny and beautiful webpages from a Paratext project*

## How it works:

Exemplar is a simple Python script that looks at the .SFM files in your Paratext project directory. It converts USFM markers (like `\c` and `\v`) into HTML.

I've focused on the markers that are most useful for my own projects. If others are interested in this tool, I'd be happy to include additional styles.

- **Self-contained** - There are no external dependencies. Pages are static HTML that can be viewed or uploaded anywhere.
- **Modern** - Tailwind provides a modern design system with built-in light and dark modes.
- **Responsive** - Page layouts have been carefully crafted to work on every size device, from the smallest phone to the largest monitor.
